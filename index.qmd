This is the project website for AY2022-23 SMT201 G1 Group 2 and our project **"Singapore Education Institutions Analysis"**, where weaim to find the impact of closures or mergers of schools on the equity of access to education in Singapore.

Our group chose to tackle this problem due to the competitiveness in primary school enrollment for schools in nearby neighborhoods. Since 2017, MOE started announcing school mergers and closures in waves every year, in order to improve ["the quality of the school experience"](https://www.gov.sg/article/why-is-the-ministry-of-education-merging-some-schools) due to declining birth rates leading to low-enrolment schools with insufficient class sizes. By merging these schools, MOE wants to maintain class sizes so schools can offer wider ranges of subjects, CCAs and programmes. Our group's objective is to find if these school mergers and closures have resulted in certain estates and subzones getting left behind in terms of access to nearby schools as their schools have been shut down.

We used accessibility analysis using a hexagon grid of Singapore and the ODNEAT3 QGIS plugin's OD Matrix Layers as Table (m:n) to get the shortest distance from each hex representing a location in Singapore to a school, using different road networks for driving, walking and MRT. We then use these shortest distances to classify each area into 3 categories in terms of the distance to their closest school to create choropleth maps showing accessibility.

Our findings show some mergers, especially for Junior Colleges, which cause a huge fall in accessibility, especially to estates in the area with large populations of young people who need these facilities. We provide some recommendations we feel will help and also talk about how future work can be done to improve on these findings.
