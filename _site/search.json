    "text": "Our project _________, aims to find the impact of closures or mergers of schools on the equity of access to education in Singapore.\nOur group chose to tackle this problem due to the competitiveness in primary school enrollment for schools in nearby neighborhoods. Since 2017, MOE started announcing school mergers and closures in waves every year, in order to improve “the quality of the school experience” due to declining birth rates leading to low-enrolment schools with insufficient class sizes. By merging these schools, MOE wants to maintain class sizes so schools can offer wider ranges of subjects, CCAs and programmes. Our group’s objective is to find if these school mergers and closures have resulted in certain estates and subzones getting left behind in terms of access to nearby schools as their schools have been shut down."
