Since 2017, MOE started announcing school mergers and closures in waves every year, in order to improve [\"the quality of the school experience\"](https://www.gov.sg/article/why-is-the-ministry-of-education-merging-some-schools) due to declining birth rates leading to low-enrolment schools with insufficient class sizes. By merging these schools, MOE wants to maintain class sizes so schools can offer wider ranges of subjects, CCAs and programmes. Our group's objective is to find if these school mergers and closures have resulted in certain estates and subzones getting left behind in terms of access to nearby schools as their schools have been shut down.\n\nWe used accessibility analysis using a hexagon grid of Singapore and the ODNEAT3 QGIS plugin's OD Matrix Layers as Table (m:n) to get the shortest distance from each hex representing a location in Singapore to a school, using different road networks for driving, walking and MRT. We then use these shortest distances to classify each area into 3 categories in terms of the distance to their closest school to create choropleth maps showing accessibility.\n\nOur findings show some mergers, especially for Junior Colleges, which cause a huge fall in accessibility, especially to estates in the area with large populations of young people who need these facilities. We provide some recommendations we feel will help and also talk about how future work can be done to improve on these findings.\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"d-inline-flex justify-content-evenly\">\n  <h4>Interactive Map Link : </h4>\n  <button class=\"btn btn-primary rounded\" onclick=\"location.href='https://smt201g2map.netlify.app/';\">Map</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n  <h4>     Github Link : </h4>\n  <button class=\"btn btn-primary rounded\" onclick=\"location.href='https://github.com/99zhebin/SMT201G2.git'\">Github</button>\n</div>\n```\n#### Poster {style=\"text-align: left\"}\n\n![](images/GIS%20Poster%20Group%202_Accessibility%20Analysis.jpg)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
